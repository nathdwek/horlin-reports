\subsection{Introduction}
The goal of this first part is to implement a minimal working simulation of a QAM communication.
In order to achieve that, the up- and downsampling blocks, the RRC filtering blocks and the baseband equivalent model of the channel, as represented in figure~\ref{fig:chain} must be implemented.

The modulator and demodulator are supplied with the assignment statement.

\subsection{Halfroot Nyquist filtering}
After its modulation, the message is upsampled and filtered with a root raised cosine filter to limit its bandwidth occupation.
The effect on the PSD of the signal is shown in figure~\ref{fig:LPF}.

\end{figure}

In order to maximize the SNR at the output, the low pass filtering is split between the transmitter and the receiver.
The halfroot nyquist filter $g(t)$ is such that the resulting operation $h(t) = g(t)*g(t)$ forms a nyquist filter which does not introduce inter symbol interference, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:noISI}

\subsection{Impact of the noisy channel}
Theory shows that a channel affected by AWGN can be modelled in the baseband by AWGN of corresponding power.
This allows to easily simulate the BER of the noisy channel.
The results of the simulations are summarized by the BER curves of figure~\ref{fig:BER}

\subsection{Questions}
\subsubsection{Simulation}
\paragraph{It is proposed to use the baseband equivalent model of the AWGN channel. Would it be
possible to live with a bandpass implementation of the system?}
The baseband signals have the advantages to first reduce the needed sampling frequency and second it allows to implement modulation and demodulation techniques regardless of the carrier frequency. That is why baseband equivalent is always preferred in modelling wireless communication channels.
\paragraph{How do you choose the sample rate in Matlab?} By first being sure the sample rate is at least 2 times greater than the maximal frequency 
\paragraph{How do you make sure you simulate the desired $\frac{E_b}{N_0}$ ratio?}
\paragraph{How do you choose the number of transmitted data packets and their length?}

\subsubsection{Communication System}
\paragraph{Determine the supported (uncoded) bit rate as a function of the physical bandwidth.}
\paragraph{Explain the trade-off communication capacity/reliability achieved by varying the constellation size.} 
By increasing the constellation size, it reduces the distance between the constellations so even for the reliability of the communication. (...)
\paragraph{Why do we choose the halfroot Nyquist filter to shape the complex symbols?}
It is used to limit the bandwidth of the signal before transmission and the second halfroot Nyquist matched filter maximizes the SNR. (??)
