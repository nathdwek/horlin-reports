\subsection{Introduction}
The goal of this first part is to implement a minimal working simulation of a QAM communication.
In order to achieve that, the up- and downsampling blocks, the RRC filtering blocks and the baseband equivalent model of the channel, as represented in figure~\ref{fig:chain} must be implemented.

\end{figure}
The modulator and demodulator are supplied with the assignment statement.

\subsection{Halfroot Nyquist filtering}
After its modulation, the message is upsampled and filtered with a root raised cosine filter to limit its bandwidth occupation.
The effect on the PSD of the signal is shown in figure~\ref{fig:LPF}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]

\caption{Nyquist filtering limits the communication bandwidth. $\beta = 0.3$, $n_{taps} = 20$ $f_m = \SI{1}{\mega\hertz}.$ \label{fig:LPF}}
\end{figure}
The figures presented in the rest of this report were produced using those same values for $\beta$, $n_{taps}$ and $f_m$.

In order to maximize the SNR at the output, the low pass filtering is split between the transmitter and the receiver.
The halfroot nyquist filter $g(t)$ is such that the resulting operation $h(t) = g(t)*g(t)$ forms a nyquist filter which does not introduce inter symbol interference, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:noISI}.

\subsection{Impact of the noisy channel}
Theory shows that a channel affected by AWGN can be modelled in the baseband by AWGN of corresponding power.
This allows to easily simulate the BER of a noisy channel.
The results of the simulations are summarized by the BER curves of figure~\ref{fig:BER}.

Unless precised otherwise, the figures presented in the rest of this reported were produced using 16-QAM.

\subsection{Questions}
\subsubsection{Simulation}
\paragraph{It is proposed to use the baseband equivalent model of the AWGN channel. Would it be
possible to live with a bandpass implementation of the system?}
Simulating in the baseband has the advantage of reducing the sampling frequency needed (at least roughly twice the carrier frequency if simulating in the passband, which is unrealistic for modern \si{\giga\hertz} links) and allowing to implement and simulate modulation and demodulation techniques regardless of this carrier frequency.
This is why the baseband equivalent model is always preferred to simulate wireless communication channels.
\paragraph{How do you choose the sample rate in Matlab?}
To be able to observe the effects of Nyquist filtering, the sampling rate must be at least twice as high as the symbol frequency. To be able to simulate sample time shift, even higher sampling rates should be used.
\paragraph{How do you make sure you simulate the desired $\frac{E_b}{N_0}$ ratio?}
Rather than adding a predetermined amount of noise to the signal, we first estimate its power in the useful frequency band, and then choose the noise power in order to obtain the required $\frac{E_b}{N_0}$ ratio.
The baseband AWGN is given by:
\[
n[k] = \sigma \cdot \left ( \mathcal{N}(0,1) + j \mathcal{N}(0,1) \right )
\]
Where $\sigma$ is given by:
\begin{align*}
\sigma &= \sqrt{N_0\cdot f_s}\\
N_0 &= \frac{1}{2n_{bits}}\cdot \sum_k{T_s{\big | s[k]\big |}^2} \cdot \frac{1}{\tfrac{E_b}{N_0}^*[\mathrm{lin.}]}
\end{align*}
Where $s[k]$ is the simulated signal at the emitter and $\frac{E_b}{N_0}^*$ is the desired $\frac{E_b}{N_0}$ ratio.
\paragraph{How do you choose the number of transmitted data packets and their length?}
In order to reliably observe a BER of $10^{-n}$, common practice is to send $10^{n+1}$ bits of data. We can send those in one simulation because the whole system is time invariant and the noise is ergodic, which means that it is possible to draw the same conclusions from the observation of one long realization as from the observation of several shorter realizations.
Additionally, the total number of bits should be a multiple of the number of bits per symbol for the modulator and the demodulator to work properly.

\subsubsection{Communication System}
\paragraph{Determine the supported (uncoded) bit rate as a function of the physical bandwidth.} From the theory, we know that $R = \frac{\log_2(N_{sym})}{T}$ with $R$ = bit rate, $N_{sym}$ = number of symbols and $T = \frac{1}{f_m}$ = symbol duration.
With Nyquist filtering: we know that $\Delta_f = 2f_m$, as shown in \ref{fig:LPF}.
Combining the two gives $R = \frac{\log_2(M)\cdot\Delta_f}{2}$

\paragraph{Explain the trade-off communication capacity/reliability achieved by varying the constellation size.}
As the constellation size increases for a given SNR, the distance between the "edges" of the constellations spots that are spread out by the noise decreases, which means overlaps and thus errors get more and more frequent.
However, as seen in the previous question, increasing the number of symbols increases the bit rate for a given bandwidth.

This means that for a given SNR, it is possible to trade off reliability (higher BER) for capacity by increasing the number of symbols. Equivalently, it is possible to adapt the constellation size to the measured SNR to optimize the channel capacity given a specified BER, as is done in DVB-S2.

\paragraph{Why do we choose the halfroot Nyquist filter to shape the complex symbols?}
Filtering is required at the emitter in order to limit the bandwidth used by the transmission.
However, ideally, filtering is also needed at the receiver in order to maximize the SNR, since the external noise can affect all frequencies.
This is why we choose to split the filtering operation between the emitter and the receiver.
Finally, ISI cancellation is required in order to be able to demodulate the signal properly.
This is achieved by splitting a raised cosine filter between the emitter and the receiver.
